# ColorPop project

### Project created during Assembly Languages course on my studies at Silesian University of Technology.

Project implements the removal of the selected color in two ways: in C++ and in ASM using vector instructions. The project core is implemented in C# and uses 2 DLLs. After launching, we can load .bmp file, chose threads number 1-64 (when program starts it automatically detects our processor threads number and sets it and sets it to the maximum), chose DLL, run it, measure execution time and save new .bmp file.
